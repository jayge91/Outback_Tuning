; sample logging configuration file for openport 2.0
; must be named logcfg.txt and be placed in the root directory of the
; microSD card inserted in the openport in order to work

; this sample logs using the MUT-II protocol over the K-line, which works
; for many mitsubishis, including the EVO 8 and 9

type=mut2

; you can also set an OBD pin to a voltage, ground, or a high impedance state
; the first number is the OBD pin number, the second number is the pin voltage with the following values:
;
; 8000-18000 : voltage in millivolts for OP2 Rev C and earlier
; 5000-25000 : voltage in millivolts for OP2 Rev D and later
; -1         : set pin to high impedance (default state)
; -2         : pull pin to ground
;
; keep in mind that if you are applying a non-zero voltage to more than one pin, all of those voltages
; must be the same

; the following setpinvoltage sets OBD pin 1 to ground, which is needed to enable logging on older Mitsubishis
; it is commented out as it is not needed for newer models (e.g. EVO 8/9)
